## Description

- My motivation for this project is to create an application that is able to update data and get data from a database
- I built this project because it will help gather infomation and store large amounts of data if needed in a database and manipulate that data.
- This application saves time in organizing all the information in one database that can be accessed easily

## Installation

To install and run this application, you have to first install the inquirer package in the JSON folder all of the dependencies. After that, you have to log in to mysql shell and run the schema. After that, the command npm run seed must be ran in the command line to seed all data. From here, we can start up the server running npm start to see the get post and put requests in insomnia. 

## Usage

This is the link to the walkthrough video demonstrating the features and all of the seeded information from the database. In the video, you can see the user can get information from the database as well as update it and delete or make post requests.
